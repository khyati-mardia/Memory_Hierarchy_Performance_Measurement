Random Write :

Files present in the folder: 

1. RandomWrite.c  : contains complete program linear read
2. randomWrite.c : where the for loop is commented which reads each element of the array
3. makefile      : makefiles for c files
4. mainscript    : mainscript takes arraysize inputs ranging from 1 to 65536 numbers and calculates time in nanoseconds. Output is obtained in time.dat file (First program execution time ,second program 			   execution time and total time in nanoseconds for various elements) Time in nanoseconds is the average access time per element.
5. script        : mainscript uses script. 

Time is calculated for reading each array elements by taking difference of (Time execution for LinearRead.c) - (Time execution for LinearRead4.c)

Steps :

i) make LinearRead.c and LinearRead4.c and create object files.
ii) Copy the mainscript by command  : chmod u+x mainscript
iii) Copy the script by command  : chmod u+x script
iv) Run command : taskset -c 1 ./mainscript

The values are obtained using perf and commands are found in mainscript and script.
 
All program files are warning free.

Make sure all mainscript, script, .c and .o files are in same folder.
